# swift-json-resume

swift-json-resume is a package which vends a module called `SwiftyJSONResume` which is a 
Swifty wrapper around the open-sourced JavaScript library  
[JSON Resumé Schema](https://jsonresume.org/). This library provides a 
standardized way to represent resumés and job listings in a structured
format. This opens you up to an eco-system of helpful tools such as resumé 
templates in PDF and HTML, online resumé builders and hosting, and more.
See [here](https://jsonresume.org/projects) for a variety of projects that
take advantage of the JSON Resumé schema.
